# tarmar-engine

The shared Tarmar turn engine: the six-phase battle loop (initiative, movement,
attacks, injury, spells) with its action catalog, combat math, spell
definitions, and the utility AI policy — pure Python, no Django anywhere in
the import chain.

Seeded from tarmar-studio's `battle/engine/` (plus `battle/spells.py` and
`battle/policy.py`) in tarmar-studio #240 milestone 1, as a clean copy taken
at tarmar-studio commit `98d80213` with imports repointed at the shared
packages; the git history of these mechanics up to that point lives in the
tarmar-studio repo. Rules **profiles** (six-phase Tarmar vs classic Melee)
arrive in milestones 2+ of the Battle⇄Melee unification plan; today the
package speaks Tarmar only.

## What it sits on

- **hexarena** — hex geometry: coordinates, facing arcs, range bands,
  reachability (`tarmar_engine.hexes` is the engine-flavoured layer over it).
- **tarmar-rules** — the drift-guarded d20 resolution core
  (`tarmar_engine.resolution` is the engine's face of it, plus the §8
  Hybrid-armour decomposition helpers).

Both are tag-pinned git dependencies in `pyproject.toml`; bump a pin by
editing the `@vX.Y.Z` ref in a commit CI tests.

## The boundary

The engine never imports Django. A consuming game adapts its models to the
`state` dataclasses at its own boundary (tarmar-studio: `battle/adaptation.py`),
injects a roller with the `common.rolling.Roller` interface, and receives
every event — per action, per roll — through a sink callback. Weapon and
armour data arrive as `weapon_class`/`armour_tier` strings; catalogs stay in
the games.

## Spec snapshot

`tarmar_engine/spec/` vendors the rules markdown the mechanics are
drift-guarded against (source of truth:
`tarmar-studio/reference/content/public-rules/`). This package's
`tests/test_rules_drift.py` guards code against the snapshot; tarmar-studio
guards the snapshot against its live rules text, so an edit to either side
without the other fails loudly somewhere.

## Development

```bash
uv sync          # installs the tag-pinned deps + dev group
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
```

Releases are tags: bump `[project] version`, tag `vX.Y.Z` on the same commit
(the tag-version-guard workflow rejects a mismatch), and consumers bump their
pin.
